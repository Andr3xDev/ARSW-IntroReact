## Description

This project demonstrates how to integrate a React frontend with a Spring Boot backend using an MVC architecture. The application serves a simple React component that consumes a REST API to display real-time data. The primary function is to fetch the current server time from an endpoint and render it. It also includes an optional feature to configure a user's name via another endpoint.
